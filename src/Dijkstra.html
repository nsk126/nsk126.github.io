        <h1>Dijkstras' Algorithmn</h1>

        <p>The Dijkstras' Algorithmn can be applied to a certain graph to 
            find the shortest distance between a start node to a goal node. 
            A feature of this Algorithmn is that it can make paths to 
            arbitary graphs with no negative edge-weights</p>

        
        <ul>
            <li>The points or nodes in a graph are connected by certain links or edges.</li>
            <li>Each edge has a set weight and this will determine the cost of <em>node A to node B via edge x</em></li>
        </ul>
